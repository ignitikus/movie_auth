# movie_auth

Make a new project called movie_auth. You will need a new github repo to go with it.

** use separate routes for user and movies

** create a checklist for yourself. a plan of action. you are not starting from scratch here but you need to think about
what needs to be done to combine the two.

** turn in the checklist


create new login app by copying the one we did
add the movie api you created earlier this week to it.
do not ruin the movie api you already didâ€¦just take the code and copy it over.
goal is to have both working together.
create basic ejs pages for all
when the user logs in, they should see a simple ejs page with anchor options:
to view movies, add a movie, update a movie
create pages for each that work.


**NO CSS required


stretch:
user can only see movie pages when logged in
validate routes
user can update profile including password
HINT: (think about the login and bcrypt)
old password
new password twice
user sees only the movies user has added
add css
